# Decision-Making
This project is my attempt to learn the content of the book Algorithms for Decision Making. <br>
The structure is fairly simple. I use both notebooks and create my own modules for things. <br>
The reason I do this is so that the notebooks can be filled with ideas/content/tests, and the bulk of complicated code (e.g for factors) can reside where it doesn't clog things up and also can be reused.
