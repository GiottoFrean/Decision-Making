# Decision-Making
This project is my attempt to learn the content of the book Algorithms for Decision Making. <br> <br>
The structure is fairly simple: <br>
I use both notebooks and create my own modules for things. <br>
The reason I do this is so that the notebooks can be filled with ideas/content/tests, and the bulk of complicated code (e.g for factors) can reside where it doesn't clog things up and can also be reused. Also I wanted to move some of the plotting code out of my notebooks as it takes a lot of space particularly with plotly, though it generates nicer graphs than matplotlib. <br>

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ is great for viewing the notebooks online.
