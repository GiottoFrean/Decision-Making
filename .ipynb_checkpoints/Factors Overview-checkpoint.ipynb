    "### Factors: What are they?\n",
    "Earlier the conditional probability tables (e.g $p(A|B,C)$) were refered to as factors.  But factors are actually a much more general way of defining a distribution, so need a proper introduction: <br>\n",
    "To start from the very most basic formulation, factors are a way of writing a probability down as the multiplication of functions of the variables. By their nature they constrain what the probability function can be. For instance, say I have 3 binary variables $A$,$B$,$C$. Say I also define two functions: $\\phi_1(A,B)$,$\\phi_2(B,C)$ which we call factors. Then we can describe a probability function with these, say: <br>\n",

    "Where $Z$ is a constant so the joint probability sums to 1. By definition, $Z=\\sum_A \\sum_B \\sum_C \\phi_1(A,B)\\phi_2(B,C)$ <br>\n",
    "Here the multiplication is called factor multiplication, but behaves just like normal multiplication. <br>\n",

    "So, probability functions can be defined by factors. You often have to calculate the normalization $Z$ though, which can be intractable.  <br>\n",

    "### 3 operations\n",
    "There are 3 operations which can be done on factors: \n",
    "1. Factor multiplication. Defined: $\\phi_1(A,B)\\cdot \\phi_2(B,C)=(\\phi_1\\cdot \\phi_2)(A,B,C)=\\phi_1(A,B)\\phi_2(B,C)$. As shown above, using this is just like normal multiplication and acts as a limit on the possible functions which can decribe $p(A,B,C)$. That limit is that a function which has $A$ and $C$ dependent even given $B$ cannot be written with the above formulation. \n",
    "2. Marginalization. This just means summing out the values for one particular variable. E.g, you want to know p(A) but only see $p(C)$ not $p(B)$. Then you sum out $B$: $p(A)=\\sum_B p(A,B)$.\n",
    "3. Conditioning. This refers to the process of taking a factor and reducing it using \"seen\" values. I.e $\\phi_1(A,B)$ becomes some $\\tau_1(A)$ when $B$ is known. Conditioning is to return a function where certain values in the function are set in place. E.g $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ becomes $f(x) = x^2 + 4$ when $y=2$."

However, finding the normalization $Z$ can be difficult if there is a large number of variables involved. Luckily, if the factors are the conditional distribution functions (sum over all variables not being conditioned on gives 1), $Z$ is normalized by default. <br>"
