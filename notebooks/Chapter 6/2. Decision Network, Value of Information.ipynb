    "We can implement the idea of utility using a directed PGM. The decision nodes are treated the same as any other variable, but we set the probability to 1 for whatever decision we are making. Then we get a set of infered values for each node using an inference algorithm. Then a utility function is used with each set of values to get an expecation. An example is given below, where you want to know whether you should take the bus, given it might rain and you could be late to work. "

    "# Value of information\n",
    "A very important question to ask is whether it is worth getting a piece of information in order to make a decision. Say, in the above example, checking the weather report. What is the value of that information? In answering this we assume a rational actor which will make the best decision given the information available to them. So, in the above case when I don't know anything my best decision is to not take the bus, with a maximum expected utility of $-0.82$. Alternatively if I know it will not rain my maximum expected utility is $-0.25$ and if I know it will it is $-1.32625$. Obviously, the probability of the observation also matters. To get the expected utility knowing information we multiply the maximum utility for each observation by the probability of the observation and sum them up. So in the above case, when the chance of rain is $30\\%$: <br>\n",
    "$$-1.32625 \\times 0.3 + -0.25 \\times 0.7 = -0.572875$$\n",
    "So, the expected utility if I can know the information is $-0.572875$ <br>\n",
    "The value of information is simply the difference between this value and the maximum expected utility knowing nothing. $-0.572875-(-0.82)=0.241725$ <br>\n",
    "So, with the information I can expect my final utility to go up by $0.241725$."
