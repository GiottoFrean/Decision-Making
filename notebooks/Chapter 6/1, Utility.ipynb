    "# Utility from first principals\n",
    "Consider a set of outcomes. We have a preference over each outcome, along with a probability of that outcome given our actions. We write $A>B$ if we prefer $A$ over $B$ and $A\\sim B$ if we don't care. The probabilities are written with $p$ as usual. \n",

    "We assume as axioms the following hold: <br>\n",
    "If $A > B$ or $B > A$ or $A \\sim C$ (completeness) <br>\n",
    "If $A\\geq B$ and $B\\geq C$ then $A\\geq C$ (transitivity) <br>\n",

    "If $A\\geq B$ then for any $C$ and probability $p$ the preference for both $A$ and $C$ as outcomes is greater than the preference for $B$ and $C$ where the probability of $B$ and $A$ is $p$ and the probability of $C$ is $1-p$. (independence) <br> <br>\n",
    "From these axioms it follows there is a utility function $U$ for which $U(A) > U(B)$ if and only if $A > B$ and $U(A) = U(B)$ if and only if $A \\sim B$ <br> <br>\n",
    "The axioms imply that the utility of a set of outcomes is given by the expectation over the utility, $\\sum_i p_i U(S_i)$ where $S$ are the outcomes."
